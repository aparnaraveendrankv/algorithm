Creating a Graph:

The code begins by creating a graph representation of the flight connections between cities. The graph is represented as an object where the keys are city names, and the values are arrays of neighboring cities. This is done by iterating through the tickets array and splitting each ticket into 'from' and 'to' cities. If a city is not already a key in the graph object, it's added with an empty array as its value. Then, the 'to' city is added to the list of neighbors for the 'from' city.
DFS (Depth-First Search) Function:

The code defines a recursive depth-first search (DFS) function named dfs. This function is responsible for exploring the graph to find a valid route from the current city to the destinations.
It takes three parameters: city (the current city being explored), visited (a set to keep track of visited cities), and route (an array to store the current route being constructed).
It adds the current city to the visited set and the route array.
It checks if the length of the route array is equal to the number of destinations. If so, it means that all destinations have been visited, and it returns the route, indicating a valid route has been found.
It then iterates through the neighbors of the current city (if any) and recursively calls the dfs function on unvisited neighbors.
If a valid route is found in the recursive call, it returns that route.
If the DFS search reaches a dead-end (i.e., all neighbors have been visited), it backtracks by removing the current city from the visited set and the route array and returns null to indicate that this path did not lead to a valid route.
Main Function (findRoute):

The main function initializes an empty visited set and an empty route array.
It starts the DFS search by calling the dfs function with the startCity, visited, and route.
The result of the DFS search is either a valid route (an array of city names) or null.
The function returns this result.
Example Usage:

The code provides an example of using the findRoute function with sample data:
startCity is 'Kiev'.
destinations is an array of destination cities in a specific order.
tickets is an array of flight tickets representing connections between cities.
The code calls findRoute with these inputs and stores the result in the route variable.
Finally, it checks if a valid route was found and prints the route or a message indicating that no valid route was found.
Overall, this code uses a depth-first search algorithm to find a route through the graph of flight connections that satisfies the given conditions. It returns the route if one exists, and otherwise, it indicates that no valid route was found.
